In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

The model uses the decision rules to predict the expected energy based on the feature set  (year, day of the week, time), then, it is  compute the root mean squared error as an indicator for fraudulent activity.

For example the feature traveltime can have a correlation with the low academic performance since the student is consuming available time to travel instead of studying. Obviously this cannot be conclusive but reasoning   might lead this kind of conclusions. Decision trees can be visualised therefore  it would help us to lead some conclusions on the causes of a bad academic performance.

    "Support Vector Classification (SVC) finds the best decision boundary between the classification datasets. To illustrate how SVC works, lets imagine an office floor where business areas, A and B, are together in the same floors and for compliance reasons they need to be split with a dry wall (In this case the dry wall is the decision boundary). All employees of A seat together and the same happens with the employees of B, therefore, it seems there is a straight way to put a wall to separate both areas.  What SVC does is to find those desks or those employees that determine the decision boundary in this case the wall. Intuitively, you will find the pairsof employees A and B that are closer to each other, and between them, it is the location where the dry wall separates the two areas. Those employees are going to be the key to figure out where to put the dry wall. In SVC terms those employees are the support vectors. The best location of the dry wall should be equidistant to the key employees A and B, or to put it in other words, SVC maximises the distance between the wall and the pair key employees A and B. \n",

    "There are some cases where the employees A and B are all mixed up and it seems there is not a straight way to split the two teams. Therefore, HR figures it out a map function that relocates the employees in another floor where they can be split in a straight way. That function is called a kernel. There are kernels of different math flavours and some of them can be customised according to the domain of the problem. For instance, HR could find a map function that moves them according to their experience or hierarchy. There are other parameters such as C and gamma that can determine how the model will work. C is like a how tolerant the corporation will be in case of a mismatch and gamma  it is going to determine how many key employees will determine the dry wall. Obviously a strong kernel and a high C and gamma will make the model to split the employees properly. However, those parameters have to be tuned up so the model can generalise in the whole distribution. \n",
